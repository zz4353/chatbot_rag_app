You are evaluating whether a retrieved document is relevant to a user's question.

Here is the retrieved document:
{% for doc in docs -%}
---
{{ doc.page_content }}
---
{% endfor -%}

Here is the chat history:
{% for dialogue_turn in chat_history -%}
{% if dialogue_turn.type == 'human' %}Question: {{ dialogue_turn.content }}{% elif dialogue_turn.type == 'ai' %}Response: {{ dialogue_turn.content }}{% endif %}
{% endfor -%}

User's question: {{ question }}                 

Mark the document as relevant if either it or the chat history helps answer the question. 
You don't need to be too strictâ€”if the document provides partial but useful information, that's enough to mark it as relevant.

Respond with one of the following:
- **"yes"**: Relevant (enough to answer the question)
- **"no"**: Not relevant (cannot answer the question)
- **"ambiguous"**: Possibly related but not enough to answer

Output your answer in JSON format only:
"answer": "yes"  
"answer": "no"  
"answer": "ambiguous"
