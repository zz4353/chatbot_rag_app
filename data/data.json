It is thesecond-most populous city in Pennsylvania(afterPhiladelphia) and the68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the2020 census. The city is located insouthwestern Pennsylvaniaat the confluence of theAllegheny RiverandMonongahela River, which combine to form theOhio River.It anchors thePittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both theOhio ValleyandAppalachia, thesecond-largest in Pennsylvania, and the26th-largest in the U.S.Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greaterPittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical areawhich includes parts ofOhioandWest Virginia. Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in thehistory of the U.S. steel industry.It developed as a vital link of theAtlantic coastandMidwest, as the mineral-richAllegheny Mountainsled to the region being contested by theFrenchandBritishempires,Virginians,Whiskey Rebels, andCivil War raiders.For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind onlyNew York CityandChicagoin corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.Deindustrializationin the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs amongblue-collar workersas steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries. Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical CenterandAllegheny Health Network, as well as68 colleges and universities, includingCarnegie Mellon Universityand theUniversity of Pittsburgh.The area has served as the federal agency headquarters forcyber defense,software engineering,robotics,energy research, and thenuclear navy.The city is home to tenFortune 500companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its446 bridges.Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including theCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium,Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, theNational Aviary, and a diversecultural district.The city's major leagueprofessional sports teamsinclude thePittsburgh Steelers,Pittsburgh Penguins, andPittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally whereJehovah's Witnessestraces its earliest origins, and was the host of the2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit. Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish GeneralJohn Forbes, in honor of British statesmanWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was aScotsman, he probably pronounced the name/\u02c8p\u026atsb\u0259r\u0259/PITS-b\u0259r-\u0259(similar toEdinburgh). Pittsburgh was incorporated as aboroughon April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\"Be it enacted by thePennsylvania State SenateandPennsylvania House of Representativesof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\" From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the finalhwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop thehwas reversed.ThePittsburg Presscontinued spelling the city without anhuntil 1921. Kingdom of France1690s\u20131763Great Britain1681\u20131781United States1776\u2013present The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by theShawneeand several other settled groups ofNative Americans.Shannopin's Townwas an 18th-centuryLenape(Delaware) town located roughly from wherePenn Avenueis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerlyHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood.: 289 The first known European to enter the region was the French explorerRobert de La SallefromQuebecduring his 1669 expedition down theOhio River.[better source needed]European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year Europeanfur tradersestablished area posts and settlements. In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to uniteCanadawithFrench Louisianavia the rivers.During 1753\u20131754, the British hastily builtFort Prince Georgebefore a larger French force drove them off. The French builtFort Duquesnebased on LaSalle's 1669 claims. TheFrench and Indian War, the North American front of theSeven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British GeneralEdward Braddockwas dispatched with MajorGeorge Washingtonas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.The British and colonial force were defeated atBraddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction onFort Pitt, named afterWilliam Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\". DuringPontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribeslaid siege to Fort Pittin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after ColonelHenry Bouquetdefeated a portion of the besieging force at theBattle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year. During this period, the powerful nations of theIroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768Treaty of Fort Stanwix, thePennswere allowed to purchase the modern region from theIroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".Both theColony of Virginiaand theProvince of Pennsylvaniaclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend theMason\u2013Dixon linewestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,Bedford County, Pennsylvaniawas created to govern the frontier. On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created asPitt Township.William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk. Following theAmerican Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of theOhio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, thePittsburgh Post-Gazettewas started, and in 1787, thePittsburgh Academywas chartered. Unrest during theWhiskey Rebellionof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing theAppalachian Mountainsor through theGreat Lakes.Fort Pitt(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into theNorthwest Territory. The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for theLewis and Clark Expedition.Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 whenMeriwether Lewispurchased akeelboatthat would later be used to ascend theMissouri River. TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, manyWelsh peoplefrom theMerthyrsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of theMerthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheGreat Fire of Pittsburghdestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape theGreat Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming fromGermany. Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of theUnderground Railroadin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada. TheAmerican Civil Warboosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.Andrew Carnegiebegan steel production in 1875 at theEdgar Thomson Steel WorksinNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into theCarnegie Steel Company. He adopted theBessemer processto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. In 1901,J. P. Morganand attorneyElbert H. GarymergedCarnegie Steel Companyand several other companies intoU.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was thenation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. ThePittsburgh Agreementwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned byT. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation ofCzechoslovakia. The city sufferedsevere floodingin March 1936. The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-AmericanGreat Migrationfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers. DuringWorld War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"was being overshadowed byJames Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\" Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures. In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. During thelate 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, thePittsburghmetropolitan statistical area(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values. In September 2009, the2009 G20 Pittsburgh summitwas held in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The80th meridian westpasses directly through the city's downtown. The city is located on theAllegheny Plateau, within theecoregionof theWestern Allegheny Plateau.TheDowntownarea (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where theAllegheny Riverflows from the northeast and theMonongahela Riverfrom the southeast to form theOhio River. The convergence is atPoint State Parkand is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include theOaklandandShadysidesections, which are home to theUniversity of Pittsburgh,Carnegie Mellon University,Chatham University,Carnegie MuseumandLibrary, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. ManyPittsburgh neighborhoodsare steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a] Thesteps of Pittsburghconsist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers. Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. TheGreat Allegheny PassageandChesapeake and Ohio CanalTowpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,and four main areas surrounding it\u2014Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods. Downtown Pittsburghhas 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with theU.S. Steel Towerbeing the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).TheCultural Districtspans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. TheFirstsideportion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctivePPG PlaceGothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by thePort Authority'slight rail systemandmultiple bridgesleading north and south.It is also home toPoint Park UniversityandDuquesne Universitywhich bordersUptown. TheNorth Side, originally the independentAllegheny Cityuntil being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions likeAcrisure Stadium,PNC Park, theAndy Warhol Museum, and theNational Aviary, among others. TheSouth Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.In the 1990s, theUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburghpurchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into theSouthSide Worksmixed-use development. The East End includes key institutions including theUniversity of Pittsburgh,Carnegie Mellon University,Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, andPhipps Conservatory. It features many parks, includingMellon Park,Westinghouse Park,Schenley Park,Frick Park,The Frick Pittsburgh,Bakery Square, and thePittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods likeShadyside.Squirrel Hillis also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.Oakland is home to several universities and thePetersen Events Center. TheStrip Districtto the west along theAllegheny Riveris an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.Bloomfieldis Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers.Lawrencevilleis a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. TheHill Districtwas home to photographerCharles Harrisas well as various African-American jazz clubs. TheWest EndincludesMt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such asSheradenandElliott. Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of thePittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, acombined statistical areadefined by theU.S. Census Bureau. Pittsburgh falls within the borders ofAppalachiaas defined by theAppalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia. Under theK\u00f6ppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either ahot-summer humid continental climate(Dfa) if the 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) isotherm is used or ahumid subtropical climate(Cfa) if the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%. The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 \u00b0F (22.9 \u00b0C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on an average 9.5 days a year,a considerableheat indexarises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 \u00b0F (\u22121.8 \u00b0C), and lows of 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.Officially, record temperatures range from \u221222 \u00b0F (\u221230 \u00b0C), onJanuary 19, 1994to 103 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is \u22123 \u00b0F (\u221219 \u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) on July 1, 1901.[b]Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995. Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918\u201319 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950\u201351.There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar toSeattle(49%). United States Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate. Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city'surban forestbetween $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance. Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due tofrequently overflowing untreated sewagefrom the city's outdated infrastructure.Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.TheAllegheny County Sanitary Authority(ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019. ThePittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority(PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.Non-Hispanic whiteswere 64.8% of the population in 2010,compared to 78.7% in 1970.By the2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,and the fifth-largestUkrainiancommunity per the 1990 census.Pittsburgh has one of the most extensiveCroatiancommunities in the United States.Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males. Themedian incomefor a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits areSquirrel HillandPoint Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year. As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts areNorth Oakland(at 21,200 per square mile) andUptown Pittsburgh(at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits,DormontandMount Oliverare Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively. Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are fromChina,India,KoreaandItaly. Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the LowerHill Districtunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of theCivic Arena, which opened in 1961.This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today. In the 1960s, theUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh(URA) aimed to revitalizeEast Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials. These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be consideredProtestant, and 32% professingCatholicbeliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population. According to a 2010Association of Religion Data Archives(ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies atBrandeis Universityestimated theJewish population of Greater Pittsburghwas 49,200.Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor toJehovah's Witnesseswas founded byCharles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from thePew Research Center. Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology,robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism,biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.ANational Bureau of Economic Research2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobilityor theAmerican Dream.Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918\u20131998Nabiscofactory, a complex known asBakery Square.Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.Pittsburgh's transition from itsindustrial heritagehas earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh'smodelin order to renew their industries and economic base. The largest employer in the city is theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\" Education is a major economic driver in the region. The largest single employer in education is theUniversity of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees. TenFortune 500companies call the Pittsburgh area home.They are (in alphabetical order):Alcoa Corporation(NYSE: AA),Arconic Corporation(NYSE: ARNC),Dick's Sporting Goods(NYSE: DKS),The Kraft Heinz Company(NASDAQ: KHC),PNC Financial Services(NYSE: PNC),PPG Industries(NYSE: PPG),U.S. Steel Corporation(NYSE: X),Viatris(NASDAQ: VRTS),Wabtec Corporation(NYSE: WAB), andWESCO International(WYSE: WCC). The region is home toAurora,Allegheny Technologies,American Eagle Outfitters,Duolingo,EQT Corporation,CONSOL Energy,Howmet Aerospace,KennametalandII-VIheadquarters.

Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of thePennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.According to thePittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, includingThe Mothman Prophecies,Wonder Boys,Dogma,Hoffa,The Silence of the Lambs,Sudden Death,Flashdance,Southpaw,Striking Distance,Mrs. Soffel,Jack Reacher,Inspector Gadget,The Next Three Days,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Zack and Miri Make a Porno, andFences.Pittsburgh became \"Gotham City\" in 2011 during filming ofThe Dark Knight Rises.George A. Romeroshot nearly all his films in the area, including hisLiving Deadseries.From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions likeFences,Mindhunter,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,Sweet Girl, andI'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy. Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them. Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include theThree Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.The local film schools includePittsburgh Filmmakers,Point Park University- Cinema & Digital Arts, andUniversity of Pittsburgh- Film Studies. Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at theCarrie Furnacesite inRankinandSwissvale. The city is served byDuquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded byGeorge Westinghouse.Water service is provided by thePittsburgh Water and Sewer AuthorityandPennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided byEquitable Gas,Columbia Gas,Dominion Resources,Direct Energy, and Novec. The two largest area health care providers are theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center(UPMC) (since 1893) andAllegheny Health Network(since 1882). The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain\u2014General Edward Hand Hospital\u2014served the area from 1777 to 1845.Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,theUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicinein 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, andMagee Womens Hospitalin 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administerCobalt therapy. In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneerThomas Starzl.In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew toBaylor University, starting its transplant program.Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned SicilyISMETTbranch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public\u2014cross species marrow transplant atUniversity of California, San Francisco.UPMC's Thomas Detre founded theInternational Society for Bipolar Disordersat a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999. The $80 million ($146 million today)UPMC Sports Performance Complexfor thePittsburgh Panthers&Pittsburgh Steelersopened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft.Hillman Cancer Centeropened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement withIBMto upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed] In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today)UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburghopened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.UPMC officially adopted inErie, Pennsylvania'sHamot Medical Centerin 2010. ThePittsburgh Penguinsannounced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered withNazarbayev Universityto help found its medical school. While he was a professor at theUniversity of Pittsburgh, American virologistJonas Salkdeveloped one of the first successfulpolio vaccines, which came into use in 1955. UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-oldStormie Jonesin 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968). The Lancetpublished a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles. Pittsburgh is acity of bridges. With 446,it has three bridges more thanVenice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges\".Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. TheSmithfield Street Bridgewas the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city'sThree Sisters Bridgesoffer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in fromInterstate 79and thePittsburgh International Airportis through theFort Pitt Tunneland over theFort Pitt Bridge. TheFort Duquesne BridgecarryingInterstate 279is the main gateway from Downtown to bothPNC Park,Acrisure Stadiumand theRivers Casino. ThePanhandle Bridgecarries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across theMonongahela River. The renovatedJ&L Steel Companybridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting theSouthside WorksandPittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County. Pittsburgh is served byPittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to theCOVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction. Locals refer to the interstates fanning out fromdowntown Pittsburghas the \"parkways.\"Interstate 376is both the \"parkway east\" connecting toInterstate 76(Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting toInterstate 79, thePittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike andInterstate 80. The \"parkway north\" isInterstate 279connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" isInterstate 579allowing access to the heart of downtown, theLiberty Tunnelsand thePPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections ofPennsylvania Route 28andU.S. Route 22also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively.Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" withInterstate 68and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as theMon\u2013Fayette Expressway,Pennsylvania Route 576andRoute 66also help traffic flow. The non-expresswayPittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt Systemserves navigation in the region. Pittsburgh International Airportprovides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to thePittsburgh metropolitan area.Arnold Palmer Regional Airportalso provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh. Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service includeMorgantown Municipal Airport(79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh),Youngstown\u2013Warren Regional Airport(81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh),Akron\u2013Canton Airport(120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh),Johnstown\u2013Cambria County Airport(60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) andErie International Airport(123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh). Amtrakprovides intercity rail service toPittsburgh Union Station, via theCapitol Limitedbetween Chicago and Washington, D.C., and thePennsylvanianto New York City. Megabus,Greyhound Lines, andFullington Trailwaysconnect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at theGrant Street Transportation Centerintercity bus terminal. Popular destinations includePhiladelphia,New York City, andWashington, D.C. Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh:Baltimore & Ohio Station,Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station,Wabash Pittsburgh Terminaland Pittsburgh Union Station. Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, theMonongahela InclineFunicularrailway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, alight railsystem that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largestbuswaysystems.Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns theDuquesne Inclinebut it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares. The Bus System lines arelabeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far asPittsburgh International Airport,Monroeville,McCandless, and the borders ofWestmoreland CountyandBeaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile,the light rail system(commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs fromAcrisure StadiumtoSouth Hills VillageandLibrary, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which servesCastle Shannon,Mt. Lebanon, andBeechview, and the other is an express line using railways throughOverbrook. Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when thePennsylvania Railroadfirst opened service between the Pittsburgh andPhiladelphia. TheBaltimore and Ohio Railroadentered the city in 1871. In 1865,Andrew Carnegieopened thePittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded theUnion Railroadin 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, whileGeorge Westinghouse'sWabtechas been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one ofNorfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, thePittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburbanConway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest.CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also hasmajor operationsaround Pittsburgh. ThePort of Pittsburghranks as the20th-largest portin the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade. Pittsburgh'ssister citiesare:\n",

        "content": "Thehistory of Pittsburghbegan with centuries of Native American civilization in the modernPittsburghregion, known asJa\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019in theSeneca language.Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where theAlleghenyandMonongahela Riversmeet to form theOhio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground whenFranceandGreat Britainfought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. FollowingAmerican independencein 1783, the village aroundFort Pittcontinued to grow. The region saw the short-livedWhiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. TheWar of 1812cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of theAllegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877railway riotsit was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by thenationwide strikesof that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of theGreat Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of theNew Deal Coalitionunder powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of thePittsburgh metropolitan areais holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio.Paleo-Indiansconducted ahunter-gathererlifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago.Meadowcroft Rockshelter, anarchaeological sitewest of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.During theAdena culturethat followed,Mound Builderserected a large Indian Mound at the future site ofMcKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of theHopewell culture. By 1700 theHaudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included theLenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and theShawnee, who had migrated up from the south.With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such assmallpox,measles,influenza, andmalaria, to which they had no immunity. In 1748, whenConrad WeiservisitedLogstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163Seneca, 74Mohawk, 35Onondaga, 20Cayuga, and 15Oneida. Other tribes were 165Lenape, 162Shawnee, 100Wyandot, 40Tisagechroami, and 15Mohican. Shannopin's Town, aLenape(Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from wherePenn Avenueis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According toGeorge Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known asHerr's Island, in what is now theLawrencevilleneighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.: 289 Sawcunk, on the mouth of theBeaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence ofShingas, a chief of theirs.Chartier's Townwas aShawneetown established in 1734 byPeter Chartier.Kittanningwas a Lenape andShawneevillage on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300\u2013400 residents. The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the firstOhio Company, aVirginianland speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-dayCumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km)wagon roadto theMonongahela Riveremploying a Lenape Indian chief namedNemacolinand a party of settlers headed by Capt.Michael Cresapto begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trailnow known asNemacolin's Trail. Theriver crossingand flats atRedstone creek, was theearliest pointand shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified asFort Burd(nowBrownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that becameBraddock's Roada few years later through present-dayNew Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond theCumberland Narrowspassbefore they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track. The nearby Native American community ofLogstownwas an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed byCeleron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory. In 1753,Marquis Duquesne, theGovernor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-dayErie, Pennsylvania, an advance party builtFort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and builtFort Le BoeufonFrench Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they builtFort Machaultat that site. Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley,Governor Dinwiddieof Virginia sent MajorGeorge Washingtonto warn the French to withdraw.Accompanied byChristopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753. As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building. Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and thenFort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw. Governor Dinwiddie sent CaptainWilliam Trentto build afortat the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitationat the site of present-dayPittsburgh. The fort, namedFort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructedFort Duquesne. Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in theBattle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chiefTanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, EnsignJoseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following theBattle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of theFrench and Indian War(1754\u20131763), or, theSeven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres. In 1755, theBraddock Expeditionwas launched, accompanied byVirginia militiaofficerGeorge Washington. Two regiments marched fromFort Cumberlandacross theAllegheny Mountainsand into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross theAppalachian Mountains.Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the futureNational Road(US40). The expedition crossed theMonongahela Riveron July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition atBraddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.In theBattle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley. On September 8, 1756, anexpedition of 300 militiamendestroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village ofKittanning, and in the summer of 1758,British ArmyofficerJohn Forbesbegan a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes builtFort LigonierandFort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13\u201314, 1758, an advance column underMajor James Grantwas annihilated in theBattle of Fort Duquesne.The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lostFort Frontenacand largely evacuatedFort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction ofFort Pitt, named after British Secretary of StateWilliam Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (seeEtymology of Pittsburgh).The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with theTreaty of Parisand French defeat.They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River. In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the \"lower town\", near the fort's ramparts, and the \"upper town\", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by ColonelHenry Bouquetand conducted byWilliam Claphamcounted 332 people and 104 houses.: 148 After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak ofPontiac's War. TheOdawaleaderPontiaclaunched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and thesiege of Fort Pittlasted for two months.Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in theBattle of Bushy Run.This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added aredoubt, theFort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of theAllegheny Mountains. TheIroquoissigned theFort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to theBritish Crown.European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third wereEnglish-American, another third wereScotch-Irish, and the rest wereWelsh,Germanand others.These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts. Increasing violence, especially by theShawnee,Miami, andWyandottribes, led toDunmore's Warin 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout theRevolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier GeneralEdward Handtook command. In 1779, ColonelDaniel Brodheadled 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroySenecavillages along the upper Allegheny. With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784Treaty of Fort Stanwix, theIroquoisceded the land north of thePurchase Lineto Pennsylvania. After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries wasboat building.Flatboatscould be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, whilekeelboatswere capable of traveling upriver. The village began to develop vital institutions.Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as theUniversity of Pittsburgh. Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to theWhiskey Rebellionin 1794. Farmers from the region rallied atBraddock's Fieldand marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states. The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop,Western Experiment.During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.In 1797, the manufacture of glass began. Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods.Blacksmithsforged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops. The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the firststeamboatwas built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. TheWar of 1812catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.When, on March 18, 1816,Pittsburghwas incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud ofcoal dust. Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, fromBaltimoretoWheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east\u2013west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the\"City of bridges\"over its two rivers.[citation needed]On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city ofPhiladelphia. In 1834, thePennsylvania Main Line Canalwas completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals. Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the firstlocomotivewest of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, theSecond Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high. Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.Because of this, on April 10, 1845, agreat fireburned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, theOhio and Pennsylvania Railroadbegan service between Cleveland andAllegheny City(present-dayNorth Side).In 1854, thePennsylvania Railroadbegan service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City: The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s. Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that theScotch Irishheld together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\" New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example,Thomas Mellon(b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerfulMellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such asJames Laughlin(b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) ofJones and Laughlin Steel Companycomprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\" In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introducedcoke-firesmeltingto the region. TheAmerican Civil Warboosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at theAllegheny Arsenaland theFort Pitt Foundry.Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun.By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when theEdgar Thomson WorksinBraddockbegan to make steel rail using the newBessemer process. Industrialists such asAndrew Carnegie,Henry Clay Frick,Charles M. Schwab, andGeorge Westinghousebuilt their fortunes in Pittsburgh.George Westinghouse's advancements included theair brakeand was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869),Union Switch & Signal(1881), andWestinghouse Electric Company(1886).Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers includingAndrew W. Mellon, withT. Mellon & Sons Bankfounded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that becameAlcoa. Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts. Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns. Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town ofVandergrift, according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hiredFrederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known aswelfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against theUnited States Steel Corporation. A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise wasWilmerdingin the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of theWestinghouse Air Brakecompany and others nearby. By about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region. Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here: Christopher MageeandWilliam Flinnoperated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of theProgressive movement statewideand supportedTheodore Rooseveltin the 1912 election. During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx ofGerman immigrants, including a brick mason whose son,Henry J. Heinz, founded theH.J. Heinz Companyin 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union. As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During theGreat Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as thePittsburgh Railway Riots.Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of thePennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes. In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) whenCarnegie Steel Company's managerHenry Clay Fricksent inPinkertonsto break theHomestead Strike. Labor strife continued into the years of theGreat Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organizedH.J. Heinzworkers, with the assistance of theCatholic Radical Alliance. Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a formerPennsylvania Railroadexecutive turned steel magnate, founded theCarnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the firstCarnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded theCarnegie Institute. In 1901, as theU.S. SteelCorporation formed, he sold his mills toJ.P. Morganfor $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded theCarnegie Institute of Technology(nowCarnegie Mellon University) and theCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The third (and present)Allegheny County Courthouseand Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.In 1907,PittsburghannexedAllegheny City, which is now known as theNorth Side. By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse: During theProhibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to theWhiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.ThePittsburgh crime familycontrolled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.Even the term \"Speakeasy\", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearbyMcKeesport, Pennsylvania. The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.In 2012,Wigle Whiskeyopened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history. During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in theProgressive Eraand was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley. In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in anexplosionof a gas tank. To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in theShadysideand East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown.Fifth Avenuewas dubbed \"Millionaire's Row\" because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work. Oaklandbecame the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland'sUniversity of Pittsburgherected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-storyCathedral of Learning.It towered overForbes Field, where thePittsburgh Piratesplayed from 1909 to 1970. Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such asSouth Side,Polish Hill,Bloomfield, andSquirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.TheStrip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers. The years 1916\u20131940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during theGreat Migrationfrom the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process: The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area: The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in theHill District. It became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such asDuke Ellingtonand Pittsburgh nativesBilly StrayhornandEarl Hinesplayed there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, thePittsburgh Crawfordsand theHomestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated theNegro National Leaguein the 1930s and 1940s. Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of theNew Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially theWPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats. Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenantDavid Lawrencegained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used theNew Dealprograms to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only \"a challenge\" but also \"an opportunity\". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage. Pittsburgh was at the center of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. duringWorld War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during theSecond Great Migrationfrom the South to the city in order to find work. David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll. Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the \"Smoky City\", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the dayas well as rivers that resembled open sewers. Civic leaders, notably MayorDavid L. Lawrence, elected in 1945,Richard K. Mellon, chairman ofMellon Bankand John P. Robinbegan smoke control and urban revitalization, also known asUrban Renewalprojects that transformed the cityin unforeseen ways. \"Renaissance I\" began in 1946. Title One of theHousing Act of 1949provided the means in which to begin. By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished forGateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished)Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lowerHill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared usingeminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included theCivic Arena, which opened in 1961.Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built. In the early 1960s, the neighborhood ofEast Libertywas also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district. In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979. Preservation efforts by thePittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans. The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including theMexican War Streets,Allegheny West, andManchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of theOld U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the \"pedestrianized\"Allegheny Center Malland apartments. The city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war erapartly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, theRIDC.Jones and Laughlin Steel Companyexpanded its plant on theSouthside.H.J. Heinz,Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa,Westinghouse,U.S. Steeland its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: theU.S. Steel TowerandThree Rivers Stadium.In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of theGolden Triangle,Point State Parkwas completed.Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations. Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following theassassination of Martin Luther King Jr.in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.[citation needed]Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.The era began with theRIDC's \"Building on Basics\" report in 1974. Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility ofUnited Steelworkersregarding wage cuts andwork-rulereforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable \"mini-mills\" and non-union mills with lower labor costs. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with thedeindustrializationof the U.S.Following the 1981\u20131982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs.Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in theRust Beltwith a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also sawwhite flightto the suburbs. In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base. Top corporate headquarters such asGulf Oil(1985),Koppers(1987),Westinghouse(1996) andRockwell International(1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the \"brain drain\") as well as massive charitable contributions by the \"home based\" companies to local cultural and educational institutions. At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier. Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day. Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as theEdgar Thomson Worksin nearbyBraddock. Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings,The University of Pittsburgh,Carnegie Mellon UniversityandDuquesne University.Carnegie Mellon Universityand theUniversity of Pittsburghhad evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.Other regional collegiate institutions includeRobert Morris University,Chatham University,Carlow University,Point Park University,La Roche College,Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and theCommunity College of Allegheny County. Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center(26,000 employees) and theWest Penn Allegheny Health System(13,000 employees). Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued. In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and thePittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation(Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies. Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of thePittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh. In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historicadaptive reusedevelopment that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice. Aided by an initial generous gift from theAllegheny Foundationin 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of theMonongahela River, opposite theGolden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in toForest City Enterpriseswhich created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people \u2013 teachers, students, adults, and visitors \u2013 to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation. During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model forcommunity development, through the work of activists such asDorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwideNeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. In 1985, theJ & L Steelsite on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.In the 1980s, the \"Renaissance II\" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such asPPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.In 1992, the new terminal atPittsburgh International Airportopened.In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced byHeinz FieldandPNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League. Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city. Present-day Pittsburgh, with adiversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine andeducationandculture, has been ranked as one of theWorld's Most Livable Cities.Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities. Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh. As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies. The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center. In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.\n",

Pittsburgh,city, seat (1788) ofAllegheny county, southwesternPennsylvania, U.S. The city is located at theconfluenceof theAlleghenyandMonongahelarivers, which unite at the point of the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d (the business district) to form theOhio River. A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includes the surrounding cities ofAliquippa(northwest),New Kensington(northeast),McKeesport(southeast), andWashington(southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east). Inc. borough, 1794; city, 1816. Area city, 58 square miles (150 square km). Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930. Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when GeneralJohn Forbesand his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesmanWilliam Pitt the Elder. The British builtFort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of theOhio. Settlers began arriving afterNative Americanforces led by Ottawa chiefPontiacwere defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundarydisputewas ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following theAmerican Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River. Pittsburgh\u2019s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial andindustrial growthin the 19th century. Ablast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron andsteelindustry that for more than a century was the city\u2019s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the \u201cIron City.\u201d The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, openedvitalmarkets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. After theAmerican Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh\u2019s population, and industrial magnates such asAndrew Carnegie,Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and theAmerican Federation of Laborwas born there in 1881. By 1900 the city\u2019s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated throughWorld War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The populationcrestedat more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic andpopulation growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity bynuclear power. By the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared\u2014a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste byunemployment, becoming a symbol of thenotoriousRust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking andmanufacturingonce thrived beforesuccumbingto widespread unemployment andpoverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries\u2014though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important\u2014and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and theservice sectorbecame increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation\u2019s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre. Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. TheUniversity of Pittsburghwas chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions includeCarnegie Mellon(1900),Duquesne(1878),Point Park (1960),Chatham (1869), andCarlow (1929) universities and two campuses of theCommunityCollege of Allegheny County (1966). Central to the city\u2019s cultural life is theCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and theAndy WarholMuseum(1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutionsaffiliatedwith the organization are theCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. ThePittsburgh Symphony Orchestraperforms at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. Thecity\u2019s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sportsvenuesopened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle:PNC Parkis home of thePirates, the city\u2019s professionalbaseballteam, andAcrisure Stadiumhouses theSteelers, its professionalfootballteam. ThePenguins, Pittsburgh\u2019s professionalice hockeyteam, plays atPPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh\u2019s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.\n",

His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named \"Win-Win: How to Get What You Want,\" started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful \u2014 and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject:Women Don't AskandAsk for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want. In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William \"Red\" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race.

This body also \napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital \nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of \nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.\nCity Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The \nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information \nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget \nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes \nto Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City \nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special \nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.\nThe Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly \nresponsible for much of the City\u2019s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, \nBureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to \ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law \nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella \norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, \nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and \nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, \nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities.\nAdditionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City\u2019s managerial \nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City\u2019s General Fund. For this reason, these \nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget.\nA comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart \npresented in this document. \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n19\nWhat is the Operating Budget?\nThe Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are \nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are \nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the \nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public \nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and \nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the \nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers\u2019 \ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.\nThe City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are \ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, \ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other \nrevenue generating mechanisms. \nThe Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what \ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal \nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in \ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.\nThe Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and \nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the \nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of \nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire \nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must \nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the \nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits \npriorities set by the City\u2019s elected public officials.\nFinally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of \nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the \nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating \nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those ",

        "content": "enacted in the initial \ncreation of the plan.\nBasis of Accounting\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh \nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.\nThe Fiscal Year\nThe City of Pittsburgh\u2019s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of \neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.\nBalanced Budget Mandate\nThe City\u2019s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues \nequal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, \nthe budget surplus is transferred into the City\u2019s reserve fund balance.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n20\nThe City\u2019s Fund Structure\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City\u2019s financial reporting system is organized on \na fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.\n \nGovernmental Funds\nGeneral Fund\nCapital Projects Fund\nCommunity Development Funds\nSpecial Revenues Funds\nFiduciary Funds\nPension Trust Fund\nAgency Funds\nThe General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain \nmost of the City\u2019s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general \nadministration.\nThe Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or \nprogram (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to \nprovide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum \nvalue of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from \nthree major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on \nthe Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.\nCommunity Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and \nhuman services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.\nSpecial Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or \ncommitted for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership \nFund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for \ntwo of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word \n\u201ctrust\u201d in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the \nfunds are not held by any trustees or custodians.\n \nFiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These \nresources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s own operations and are custodial in nature. The \nCity\u2019s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.\n\u2022 The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for \nfirefighters, and a third for municipal employees.\n\u2022 Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax \nrefunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other \nPost-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of \nFiduciary Funds.\nBudget Allocations\nThis budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that \ncomprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n21\nThe City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and \nElected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the \nmost specific:\n Fund ... Cost Center ... Subclass ... Object Account\nThe legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101.

The account string begins \nby identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (City division), subclass (expenditure category), object account \n(expenditure category detail), and fiscal year.

There are seven subclasses.\n \nRevenues\n41  Tax Revenue\n42  License and Permit Revenue\n43  Charges for Services\n44  Fines and Forfeitures\n45  Intergovernmental Revenue\n46  Interest Earnings\n47  Miscellaneous Revenues\nTax Revenue\nTaxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are \nmany that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City. \nThey are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.\nReal estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School \nDistrict, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within \nthe City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property \nAssessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate \ntax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax \nrate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny \nCounty Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).\nOther sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, \nthe Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the \nDeed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax. \nEarned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn \nwages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 \npercent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, \nand capital gains are commonly excluded.\nThe Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied \nat the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed \nindividuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide \nservices within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n23\nFinally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of \nPittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s pension fund until 2051.\nIn 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.\nCity of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for \nthe improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop \nthe Violence Trust Fund section for more information.\nNon-tax Revenue\n\u201cNon-tax re",

        "content": "venue\u201d is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not \ndirectly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction \npermits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as \ninterest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue \nfor the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.\nEach year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of \ngrants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account \nconsists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most \nintergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local \nentities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal \nagencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the \nquality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden. \nMany City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees \ninclude payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale \nof rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and \ngovernmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to \nreceive medical care.\nIn 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.\nHow Does the City Spend Money?\nThe tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents \nranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by \ndepartment or division and by subclass.\nMajor expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers\u2019 compensation claims for City \nof Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past \nand current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart \nbelow illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) \ncontributions, health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n24\n$ (Millions)\nSelect Major Expenditures, 2018-2022\n2018 2019 2020\n2021 2022\nHealth Insurance\nWorkers' Compensation\nPension and OPEB\nDebt Service\n0\n50,000,000\n100,000,000\n150,000,000\nHealth Insurance\nThese expenditures are categorized within the Personnel \u2013 Employment Benefits subclass.

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of \nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\n \nDebt Service\n82101  Interest Expense - Bonds\n82103  Principal\nBudget Creation Process\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, \npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by \nCity Code.\nAfter receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit \nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, \nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the \nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if \nany, should be funded.\nThe Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to \ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor\u2019s \nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.\nCity Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After \nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a \nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of \nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to \ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before \nDecember 31st was 1931.  \nUpon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Operating and \nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City\u2019s expenditures and revenues, provides \nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments. \nAnalysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure \ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important \nmanagement initiatives.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n26\nFive-Year Financial Forecast\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both \nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise \nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.\nThe five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This \naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for \nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might \nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus \nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.\nRevenue Forecast\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and \ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the \nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nProjected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.\nThe Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. \nPrevious years\u2019 financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City\u2019s enterprise resource planning \n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue \nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.\nIn addition to the previous years\u2019 financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic \nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue \ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the \nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the \nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.\nRevenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of \nPittsburgh\u2019s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are \ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue as",

Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections \nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.\nExpenditure Forecast\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these \nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known \nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension \ncontributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).\nOMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and \ninitiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are \nsubject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This \nis accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,\nLastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described \nabove. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in \nachieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department.

In general, each separate \nsection of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference \nbetween each report within a section. \nDepartmental Sections\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in \nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been \nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the \nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget. \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n28\nOrganization Chart\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, \nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with \nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.\nDepartmental Overview\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the \norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the \ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency, \nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.\nPosition Summary\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or \u201cFTE,\u201d \nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The \u201cRate/Grade\u201d category indicates how an \nemployee\u2019s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees \ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a \u201c12\u201d in the \u201cHours/Months\u201d column \nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or \nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The \n\u201cBudget\u201d column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The \n\u201cVacancy Allowance\u201d adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions \nthroughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.\nSubclass Detail\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass \nand object account level. For example, the general \u201cProfessional and Technical Services\u201d subclass will highlight \nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as \u201cAdministrative Fees,\u201d \u201cWorkforce Training,\u201d and \n\u201cComputer Maintenance.\u201d Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted \nexpenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 \nbudgeted amounts.\nUnder the Personnel \u2013 Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular\n salary represents \nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining \nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or \nseasonal workers, as well as student interns.

The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and \ncurrent laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic \nand technical factors.\n2024 Operating Budget Revenue\nRevenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2024, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $541.8 \nmillion and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $172.4 million, comprising approximately 75.9 percent and 24.1 \npercent of total revenues, respectively. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.5 percent in 2024 over the \n2023 budget. \nTax Revenue\nTax revenues incorporate all major taxes that are levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For each tax, total revenues \ninclude current year collections, prior year collections and penalties and interest. Tax revenues are forecast to \nincrease by 1.2 percent in 2024 over the 2023 budget and to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\nReal Estate Tax\nTotal real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $151.8 million in 2024, an estimated 4.7 percent decrease from the \nprior year. The real estate tax is the largest source of revenue in the 2024 Operating Budget, comprising \napproximately 28.0 percent of tax revenues and 21.3 percent of total revenues. Current year real estate tax \nliability (the amount billed at the beginning of the year) is calculated by applying the millage rate (8.06 mils) to \nAllegheny County's assessed value of property. On average, residential property comprises approximately 55 \npercent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and non-residential property comprises \napproximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in 2013, the total assessed value of \nproperty in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year since 2003. The county-wide \nreassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased \nby 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per \nyear, more in line with historical growth. \nThe largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the \nAllegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2 \npercent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax.  Real estate tax incentives for future years are \nestimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax \nrevenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.\nEarned Income Tax\nTotal earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $136.2 million in 2024, an estimated 7.3 percent increase over \nthe prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City \nof Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a 3.0 percent growth rate, with \na downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical \ncollections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.4 percent each year through 2028.  \nPayroll Preparation Tax\nTotal payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $76.3 million in 2024, an estimated 16.0 percent increase \nover the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers \nand net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations and joint ventures who \nperform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh.  Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\n40\npreparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-\nfarm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent on average.  Total payroll preparation tax \nrevenues are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent each year through 2028.\nParking Tax\nTotal parking tax revenues are budgeted at $51.6 million in 2024, a 1.9 percent decrease from the prior year. The \nparking tax is levied at a rate of 37.5 percent on fees charged for parking or storing cars within the City of \nPittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and \nthe tax rate and gross Allegheny County product as independent variables. Estimated gross Allegheny County \nproduct is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic \nindicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.7 percent each \nyear through 2028. \nDeed Transfer Tax\nDeed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $59.1 million in 2024, an estimated 13.7 percent decrease compared \nwith the prior year. This decrease is related to fewer property transactions in comparison to last year as a result of \nrising interest rates.  The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh. \nThe total tax paid, which is typi",

The first independent variable is the residential tax base, \nwhich consists of existing single-family home sales multiplied by the average price of an existing single-family \nhome. The other independent variables are the tax rate and a dummy variable for years in which the sale of a \nnon-residential property exceeded $100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 \npercent on average each year over the next five years.\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief\nRegional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $25.8 million in 2024, an estimated 3.3 percent increase over the \nprior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of \n1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh\u2019s percentage is determined by \na formula that compares the City\u2019s tax revenues and the market value of property per capita with that of all \nmunicipalities in Allegheny County. Retail sales (a proxy for sales tax collections) are forecast to grow by 3.1 \npercent on average over the same period.  Act 77 tax relief is forecast to increase by 2.0 percent each year \nthrough 2028.\nAmusement Tax\nTotal amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $18.9 million in 2024, an estimated 9.2 percent increase over the \nprior year. The amusement tax is levied at a rate of 5 percent on the gross admission to events that provide \nentertainment within the City of Pittsburgh, excluding non-profit performing arts organizations. Amusement tax \ncollections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports \nteams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from \nopposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports \nteams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30 \npercent is forecast with consumer price index (inflation) to generate a more conservative forecast. Total \namusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.6 percent each year through 2028.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\n41\nLocal Service Tax\nTotal local service tax revenues are budgeted at $15.7 million in 2024, an estimated 3.2 percent increase over the \nprior year. The local service tax is a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh earning \ngreater than $12,000 annually. The local service tax forecast uses annual employment forecasts for the City of \nPittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.6 percent per year \nthrough 2028.\nNon-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee\nTo offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident \nsports facility usage fee was established in 2005. Total non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are \nbudgeted at $4.4 million in 2024, an estimated 99.3 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of \nthe earned income generated by non-residents using a publicly funded facility to engage in an athletic event or \nperformance.  This results in a conservative forecast with growth slightly above the consumer price index. Total \nnon-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are forecast to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\nTelecommunication Licensing Fee\nThe telecommunication licensing fee is budgeted at $1.2 million in 2024, a 26.5 percent decrease compared with \nthe prior year. The fee is levied on telecommunications companies for the privilege of running lines under public \nstreets, bridges and sidewalks. Total telecommunication licensing fee collections are forecast to increase by 1.0 \npercent each year through 2028.\nInstitution and Service Privilege Tax\nThe institution and service privilege tax is budgeted at $460,644 in 2024, an estimated 16.8 percent decrease \nover the prior year. The tax is levied on the gross income of foundations, partnerships and non-profit organizations \nthat provide a public service. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.7 percent each year through 2028, \nroughly in line with inflation. \nNon-Profit Payments for Services\nNon-profit payments for services are contractual payments from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for \nsome of their properties that have been taken off the tax rolls. The total budget for this line item is $438,891 in \n2024.\nOutdoor Advertising Excise Tax\nCity Council enacted an outdoor advertising excise tax in 2013.

Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few \nyears, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\n53\nhealth and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension \nfunding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.\n\u2022 Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required \ncosts that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across \neach department. \n\u2022 Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in \n2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City\u2019s critical infrastructure \nneeds.\n\u2022 PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the \nCapital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d) transfers are funds that the City spends on \ncapital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital \nImprovement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, \neconomic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to \ncontribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing \n$22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.\nMost non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout \nfiscal year 2028.

In the 2024 Operating Budget, total \nplanned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures.

All services provided to the residents \nand visitors of the City of Pittsburgh, the County of Allegheny, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be \ndelivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nThe roles and responsibilities of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire as related to public safety include emergency \nmedical care, fire investigation, code enforcement, training, logistics, and suppression. Suppression and \nemergency medical services are the largest functional area in terms of responsibility and resources. The \nsuppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are \nto protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by \nbecoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The \nBureau provides these services through the following four divisions:\nAdministration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau.  This activity includes budget \nand finance; payroll; employee relations, strategic planning; record and data gathering, facility and fleet \nmanagement.\nOperations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and \nvisitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and \nemergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care \nto sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each \nyear. \nPlanning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training \nAcademy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of \nfire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical \nrescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics. The PBF expanded its role in disaster preparedness and \nresponse, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in \nplanning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh, \nand other transportation emergencies. All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being \nassigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for \nall members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City \nprograms such as the Civic Leadership Academy.\nRisk Management - Enforces the City\u2019s hazardous material code, the International Fire Code, investigates \ncomplaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations.

Through partnerships and program development, \nthe Office will focus on:\nDeveloping a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community \nmembers, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and \nevaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of \nresources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public \nSafety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis \nwill be utilized to build this continuum.\nImplementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to \ncommunity needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders \nhave significant exposure to issues that affect community members\u2019 health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with \nthe Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and \nresponses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by \ncommunity members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate \ntranslational experiences.\nConsistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and \naccountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the \ncurrent response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, \nprioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will \npartner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and \nmay not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives \nfocused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.\nNote: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.\n \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget                                Office of Community Health and Safety\nFiscal Year 2024  102300\n196\n2023 Accomplishments\n\u2022 Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh. In the last \nmonth alone, the team has successfully prevented 3 jumpers from reaching completion. It also played an \nintegral role in resolving a 90+ person migrant crisis at the Greyhound. In total, it has seen 107 patients \nserved, 307 service encounters, and 143 reasons for referral since April 2023. \n\u2022 Launch of the Trauma Survivors Assistance Program this summer, with already achieving over 700 \nencounters and providing support to the community during and after the Garfield shooting. \n\u2022 The Office of Community Health & Safety launched a Downtown Crisis Response Case Conference with \nDHS Leadership, outreach organizations, and OCHS Leadership to best address the most complex cases \naffecting downtown. The target audience are individuals who are in crisis, experience homelessness and \nextreme poverty, and have high engagement with law enforcement and the criminal/legal system. \n\u2022 Secured $1 million in federal funding to launch Post Overdose Support Teams (POST) next year which \nwill perform secondary response to individuals who refuse medical treatment after experiencing an \noverdose. The team will consist of certified peer recovery specialists and case managers.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide \nindependent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board \nwill thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; \nevaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices \nthrough public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor \nand Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.\nA Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the \nstaff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and \nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nInvestigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the \nCPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake \nCoordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of \nthe complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the \ncomplaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a \npreliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides \ndaily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and \nthe results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an \ninvestigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through \ninvestigation to a public hearing at the Board\u2019s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public \nhearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from \ncomplaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy \nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.\nCommunity Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens \nand police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and \ncivilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and \npersonal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB\u2019s \nrole and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the \npublic is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen \nand the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as \noffensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the \nprocess, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.\nBoard and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, \nincluding police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human \nrights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement pol",

The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City\u2019s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, \nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.\nThe Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to \nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City\u2019s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant \nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our \ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain \ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed \nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, \nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows \nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the \nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.\nIn 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects \nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding \nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield \nBridge supported by a State grant award.. \nNew Grants by Department, Office, or Bureau\n7.2%\n4.9%\n4.4%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.8%\n10.4%\n52.7%\n18.9%\nDPW\nBudget\nInnovation and Performance\nPlanning\nMayor's Office\nPolice\nFire\nOCHS\nPublic Safety - Admin\nMobility & Infrastructure\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \nFiscal Year 2024  Grants\n288\nActive Grants\nAmount Spent and Remaining Balances are as of November 1, 2023\nCity Council as a Body\nJDE \nNumber Sponsor Grant  Amount \nAwarded\n Amount \nSpent\nRemaining \nBalance\n0129400356 PA Historical Publications \nand Records Commission Increase access to City of Pittsburgh Records $ 8,016 $ 8,016 $ \u2014 \n 129400357\nNational Historical \nPublications and Museum \nCommission \nDigitize Historic Council Records  133,934  124,255  9,679 \n1029400411 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganizations in each council district  10,000  \u2014  10,000 \n1029400412 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganizations in each council district  10,000  \u2014  10,000 \n1029400413 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganizations in each council district  10,000  \u2014  10,000 \n1029400414 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganizations in each council district  10,000  \u2014  10,000 \n1029400415 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganizations in each council district  10,000  \u2014  10,000 \n1029400416 Dick's Sporting Goods \nFoundation\nProvide sports equipment to youth sports \norganiz",
